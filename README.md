TPB Quote Machine
=================
This is a simple Django web application that outputs quotes from the TV show Trailer Park Boys. It uses the ReactJS library for the front end.

The quotes were retrieved from https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Trailer_Park_Boys . Be aware that these quotes are often vulgar and NSFW.

This web app was inspired by a project from FreeCodeCamp, and was carried out as an exercise for learning Django and ReactJS.
